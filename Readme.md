Origami
=======

Make pretty 'folding' animations using suites or equations. Take a look at the [demo](http://jeremiet.github.com/origami).

HOW TO
------

Add jquery into your html page:
```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
```
Next, add `origami.css` and `origami.js`:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/origami.min.css"></script>
<script src="path/to/origami.min.js"></script>
```
Eventualy, use it!
```js
// Create animation...
var anim = $('#your-elem').origami({
  delay: 35,
  f: function (x) {
    return 10 * x + 10; // f(x) = 10x + 10
  }
});
// ...and trigger it :)
$('#on').on('click', anim.on);
$('#off').on('click', anim.off);
```
_Markup_:
```html
<div id="your-elem">
  <!-- Add `back` class to the elem behind -->
  <div class="back">
    Hello world!
  </div>
  <!-- ...then add your image -->
  <img src="path/to/img">
</div> <!-- #your-elem -->
```

You can create animations from :

- an equation like _f(x) = 10xÂ² + 10_
- a sequence giving a step, a start, and a type (arithmetic or geometric)

### Options

- __f__ - equation to use to create the curve
- __suite__ - suite to use (instead of equation)
- __delay__ - animation delay (ms)
- __shadows__ - boolean to activate or not the shadows
- __frags__ - fragments number
